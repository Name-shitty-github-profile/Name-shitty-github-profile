# Hello!
Hello! My name is No√©mie!
<br>
I am from Canada, you know the country with polar bears, maple sirop and [a very strange president](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gusu00n9Nhk)!
<br><br>
I have been coding for quite a while now, troughout my journey as a programmer I've coded quite a lot of things, let's check some out!
# Rouille Tabarnak
You know, programming is always in english but what if it isn't especially in a weird and country specific tongue? Well [Rouille Tabarnak](https://github.com/Name-shitty-github-profile/rouille-tabarnak) comes right into hand! (Basically a very silly version of Rust)
# IDE
I once loved code editors, I even spent 95% of my time in one but I wanted to make my own, so I took 9 hours of my time, to make two of them (very basic and mostly a challenge to test how fast could I code)
<br><br>
One that is 
## [Console based (4 hours)](https://github.com/Name-shitty-github-profile/4-hours-IDE)
and one that is 
## [Tkinter based (5 hours)](https://github.com/Name-shitty-github-profile/5-hours-tkinter-IDE)
# The Holy Donut?
You probably all know about HolyC, a language made by a guy that said was guided from god, even made an OS (templeOS), this story was facinating to me, like a netflix story. I loved it so much and wanted to try the language, so I asked myself a question : "What could be the most silly thing I could do in HolyC?" But then, I got bored and went trought my phone, I saw a donut render with a code in the shape of a donut. At first glance I didn't think anything of it and then a second later I was like what a brilliant idea!!! THAT WAS IT I WAS GOING TO MAKE THIS IN HOLYC SO HERE I WENT AND OH BOY I DID.<br>
![I LOVE THE BREAD, THE BAGUETTE, FRANCE!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46300167/206304169-f15cd658-7cdf-4a56-931c-9e0943c43f28.gif)
# Chess?
I wanted to play chess one day and was too bored to play a real game as my friend circle is as full as this array in this code
```asm x86
section .data
    friends db "Mark", 0
            db "Gerard", 0
            db "Anais", 0
            db "Tobby", 0
    friends_end equ $

section .text
global _start

_start:
    mov esi, friends

print_loop:
    mov eax, esi
    add esi, 6
    cmp esi, friends_end
    jb print_loop

    mov esi, friends

clear_loop:
    mov byte [esi], 0
    add esi, 6
    cmp esi, friends_end
    jb clear_loop

    mov esi, friends

print_cleared_loop:
    mov eax, esi
    add esi, 6
    cmp esi, friends_end
    jb print_cleared_loop

    mov eax, 1
    xor ebx, ebx
    int 0x80
```
(It's a joke, the array is empty)
I made a discord bot that could play chess so I could have my online friends to play chess with me (they said no, so I cried in my room for hours and hours on end)
# Cat Encoder
I always loved cats, I tought they were super cute but then I got a cat that kept on yelling, I wanted to get the MIAW MIAW MIAW MIAW MIAW, out of my head, so I went to my computer and found the solution to my problem! Coding something that will always make me remember this cat yelling, a moew moew encoder, that can encode anything in a really non useful way but it sounded silly and I wanted to get this out of my mind!
<br>But the problem wasn't fixed but then I found the only thing that could fix it! <br>

# Schrollclicker
I had a problem since childhood, I was not clicking fast enough for minecraft, so then I got creative and tought to myself, if only there was a way I could convert my schrollwheel to clicks. BUT THEN I KNEW THAT I COULD (totally not because I saw someone do it) So I did and it worked like a charm, a bit too much tho, LIKE WAY TOO MUCH (it made my pc crash like 4 times)
# iHorizon, the big one.
Oh boy. So if you use disord you probably heard of this giant discord bot called iHorizon, it's pretty big and cool.<br><br>
## The foundation
So basically, Anais was part of a discord team (Yeah that sounds cringe but that was 2020 so)
<br>
They needed a protection bot, so she made one, named iHorizon.
<br>
I joined the team too (Please don't judge me), I became friends with Anais.
<br>
She introduced me to iHorizon
## Opening it up
I loved iHorizon, how it worked, etc
<br>
So like any normal people when you love something, you open it up, right?
<br> 
The code was the worst ever, NOT OPTIMIZED AT ALL AND I LOVE OPTIMISATION, IT'S MY REASON TO LIVE.
<br>
I got in a call with her and we started talking. (I was basically yelling at her while she said "Sorry, I'm sorry please don't hurt my family")<br>
And then she proposed to me if I wanted to help with the bot.
<br>
I said yes.
![FOOTER](./footer.png)
<br>
So I started to spent countless hours working on the bot, day and night, studying during the day, yelling and coding during the night..
<br>
Bam! iHorizon was clean! Fixed, all great I loved it.
<br>
So we added more and more features again and again it was awesome and as the bot continued to grow, its usercount even surpassed some country population number.
<br>
Yep, I was part of something big and great. That I will keep on improving everyday of my life! :)
<br>
(also maybe an RPG one day?)
