# Hi.
To present myself, I'm very weird.
<br>
I'm a dev who "made it" and then left the community. I switched from coding to stand-up comedy, by the way it was super fun!
<br>
And now. I'm here to probably make something big, SOMETHING REALLY FUCKING HUGE MAN.
<br><br>
Soon, ping me on [iHorizon](https://discord.gg/ihorizon) to know more about my newest project. But know one thing, it's going to be the best thing ever fucking created.
